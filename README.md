A Twitter bot that does a sentiment analysis based on terms in tweets it is mentioned in in specific format. e.g:
@Covid_16_Bot covid19

@Covid_16_Bot being the twitter handle for the bot.

Takes 200 recent tweets for each search term (terms can be seperated by tweeting with the text " OR " between different search terms).

Does a sentiment analysis and then tweets with an @handle of the original tweeter with the result as positive/negative/neutral and a graph.
